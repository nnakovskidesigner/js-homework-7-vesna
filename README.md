The task here was to create unorganised list in html, then through JS to add 4 li elements and to add image in each one of them. The pictures are free choice, they can either be uplaoded locally or through the web. Then their height and width need to be stylised with JS as well. The last thing was to add an event on every image, so that when the mouse is over the image gets border and box shadow, and removed when the mouse is away.
